# Sumurai App
An iOS application created for Microsoft's New Technologist Internship.

## What is Sumurai
When prompted to create an app for visual learners our group wanted to tackle a problem we all suffered from as busy college students, information overload. 

As a college student in today's day and age a task as simple as a class paper can seem intimidating. Combing through dozens of articles while conducting research can be time consuming, boring, and overwhelming. 

Sumurai aims to combat this by taking an online source, summarizing it's components, and presenting it to the user in a interactive visual format.

## How it works
1. Select an existing file or choose your own. Upload a new file from your device or use its URL.
2. Wait while we transform your document!
3. Explore your new visualized document and all of its summarized content.
